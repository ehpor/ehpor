## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emiel Por, and I am a 51 Pegasi B Fellow at UC Santa Cruz.

My research focuses on advanced instrumentation for the direct imaging of exoplanets for both ground- and space-based telescopes. I develop novel coronagraph solutions and methods for post-coronagraphic wavefront sensing. Segmented primary mirrors, such as the one proposed for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), require that all segments stay aligned to within a few picometers during a coronagraphic observation. Therefore, besides a high-performance coronagraph, high-order wavefront sensing and control will be necessary for future giant segmented space telescopes. I work on developing novel coronagraph solutions that jointly optimize both contrast and wavefront sensing and control.
